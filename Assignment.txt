Assignment

• Fork the repo https://github.com/vijaykiran/random-repo - there are 3 CSV files in the repository.
• Write a program in Java that will ask the user for a country code, and lists the airports and
runways in that country. If the code is not found, the program will error out.
• The file also contains country names, so the user can enter country name as well (case-insensitive)
• Feel free to use any library/framework as necessary.

Question:

• Do you want a Swing GUI?
    - Not needed, but if you think it is easier for you and you have enough time, feel free to do it.

• The CSV files contains a lot of information. Do I store all the data or only the mandatory information?
    Just the information you need to output, so you can strip out the columns you don't need.
